    <p><em>Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire</em> is my latest tabletop role-playing game project. Thematically,
      it's based on my original <a href="vd.html">Vox Draconis</a> game. It's not set in the original game's "Desova"
      setting, but it takes a
      few cues from that world. Dinosaurs are as prevalent as other wildlife. The tech level is somewhere between the
      Stone Age and Tolkienesque fantasy. The game system makes a few nods to the original's, but is built around the
      player characters being true heroes and not rampaging murderhobo tomb raiders.</p>
    <p>"Treasure" as older tabletop role-playing games define it is much less of a focus. Experience Points are awarded
      for having an impact on the game world, and not explicitly for defeating monsters. It is perfectly plausible to
      run a campaign where no combat takes place.
    </p>
    <p>The game is still very rough. I will post the rules here when it's playable and iterate from there. For the time
      being, I intend to post updates here as I'm working on the rules.</p>
