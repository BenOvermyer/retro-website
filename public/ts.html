<b>PART 1: INTRODUCTION TO TIMESCAPE<br>
</b>
<p>
Timescape is a Vox Draconis setting in which the Rifts have been
permanently torn open, and wizards have gained knowledge of chronomagic,
or time magic. This knowledge is a threat and also an aid to the
people of Vox Draconis. This manual will illustrate 2 new planes
and their denizens, equipment lists, and other interesting accessories
for Vox Draconis Timescape campaigns. You must own a copy of the
Vox Draconis Basic Rules. <br>

<b>Section A: Description<br>
</b>
<p>
The Plane of Law is a plane of complete order. It is very difficult
for inhabitants of other planes to live here, because here no
one has different thoughts. No monsters live here, only humanoid

is no day or night, just an eternal darkness. This plane is considered
more dangerous than any other plane, except the Plane of Evil.
