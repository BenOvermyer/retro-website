      <h1>Part 1: Introduction To Timescape</h1>

      <p>Timescape is a Vox Draconis setting in which the Rifts have been
         permanently torn open, and wizards have gained knowledge of chronomagic,
         or time magic. This knowledge is a threat and also an aid to the
         people of Vox Draconis. This manual will illustrate 2 new planes
         and their denizens, equipment lists, and other interesting accessories
         for Vox Draconis Timescape campaigns. You must own a copy of the
         Vox Draconis Basic Rules.</p>

      <h2>Section A: Description</h2>

      <p>The Plane of Law is a plane of complete order. It is very difficult
         for inhabitants of other planes to live here, because here no
         one has different thoughts. No monsters live here, only humanoid
         creatures called Robots that cannot think for themselves. There
         is no day or night, just an eternal darkness. This plane is considered

         to Perception, but they are completely blind, since they don't
         even have eyes. They use their other senses at superhuman levels.
         Robots have black skin and are bald. They tend to become good-aligned
         when they leave the Plane of Law, and try to right wrongs.</p>
