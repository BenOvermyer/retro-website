    <h1><a class="anchor" name="part1"><strong>Part 1: Introduction</strong></a></h1>

    <p>Hi, and welcome to Vox Draconis, the game of high adventure in
      a somewhat confused world of dinosaurs, dragons, monsters, and
      men. The Basic Rules, this book, contains the basic mechanics
      for running and playing a game of adventure in the Known Planes.
      You only need some six-sided dice, a pencil, paper, and this rulebook
      to begin your adventures. This game is a role-playing game, in
      which each player creates a character and then, under the supervision
      of the games master, or referee, they act them out.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="HowtoPlay">How To Play</a></h2>

    <p>Once you have the materials and players for the game, you, the
      referee, must have an adventure set up or bought which you will
      base your game on. The adventure can be anything from defeating
      a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex to sealing an active volcano. The world
      of Vox Draconis is a vast one. Once you have the game set up,
      your players organized into an adventuring party, and all your
      props collected, you can begin. See the section on Dragonworld
      Creation for information on building your own worlds.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="TheDiceSystem">The Dice System</a></h3>

    <p>The six-sided dice used in Vox Draconis are referred to in the
      rules using this format:</p>

    <p>(Number of dice)d(number of sides)</p>

    <p>For example, 4d6 means roll four six-sided dice.</p>

    <h1><a class="anchor" name="part2"><strong>Part 2: Character Generation</strong></a></h1>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Character">How to Create a Character</a></h2>

    <p>Creating a character could be an art in itself.
      The character that you create is like an incarnation of yourself,
      but in a different world, and with different abilities. Before
      you make one, you must understand that this character should be
      well described, so you "know" the character. Here is
      a list of the steps that must be taken to generate a character:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Roll 3d6 for each of your ability scores.</li>
      <li>Select a race, and adjust your ability scores accordingly.</li>
      <li>Select a character type.</li>
      <li>Name the character.</li>
      <li>Roll 3d6 x 10 for your starting funds(in Metal Coins)</li>
      <li>Describe your character's features, such as sex, weight, height,
        eye color, etc.</li>
      <li>(OPTIONAL) Write a brief history of your character,</li>
    </ol>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Types"><strong>Character Types</strong></a></h2>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="warriors">Warriors</a></h3>

    <p><strong>Dragon Rider:</strong> The Dragon Riders are a proud group. They bond with
      a dragon when both are very young. If the dragon is harmed, it
      affects its rider considerably. For every 10 dragon Life Points(LP)
      lost, the rider loses one. Dragons always have 1d6x10 LP to begin
      with, and do 3d6 damage. The rider has 1d6+2 LP. The Prime Requisites
      for Dragon Riders are strength and spirit of 13.</p>

    <p><strong>Raptor Rider:</strong> Raptor Riders are vicious hunters. They bond with
      a raptor when they defeat it in battle. Only 40% of the time will
      a character become a Raptor Rider. Raptors have 2d6 x 5 LP, but
      do 5d6 damage due to their vicious nature. Raptor Riders have
      1d6+2 LP. The Prime Requisite for Raptor Riders is strength of
      13.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="wizards">Wizards</a></h3>

      of Shadow Magic. They get a bonus to the base chance of Teleporting
      (+30%) if their Magical Ability score is higher than 15. They
      must have a Magical Ability score of 13. Shadowmages have 1d6+1
      LP.</p>

    <p><strong>Firemage:</strong> Firemages have mastered fire-based magic. They use Fire
      Magic. They get a bonus to base chance of Command Lava (+10%

      a Magical Ability and Spirit of 14. They have1d6-1 LP.</p>

    <p><strong>Starmage:</strong> Starmages are actually astronomers with no magical powers.
      They do, however, have the only pre-hi-tech equipment in Vox Draconis:
      semi-automatic crossbows which do 2d6 damage. These auto-load
      weapons require bolts, though. Starmages also have the ability
      to predict the future (40% chance). They must have a Perception
      score of 15. Starmages have 1d6 LP.</p>

    <p><strong>Darkmage:</strong> Darkmages are also called necromancers, the feared warlocks
      that raise the dead.They are the most dangerous of all the mages,
      as they have Necromantic Magic. They gain no bonuses for extra
      Magical Ability points. They need a Magical Ability score of 15.
      They have 1d6 LP.</p>

      per song per level). Bards must buy a musical instrument of some
      type. They need a Spirit, Perception, and Dexterity score of 14.
      They have 1d6 LP.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="others">Others, Including Shapeshifters</a></h3>

    <p><strong>Raptorian:</strong> Raptorians can transform into Velociraptors. They do
      the same amount of damage as normal raptors (see Raptor Riders
      ). They require a Shapeshifting score of 15. Raptorians also get
      2d6 LP.</p>

    <p><strong>Dragonoid:</strong> Dragonoids can transform into Gray Dragons. They do
      the same amount of damage as normal dragons, but have 2d6+3 LP.
      They require a Shapeshifting score of 16.</p>

    <p><strong>Priest:</strong> Priests are the "voices of the gods", meaning
      they can use the powers of their worshipped god. In return, the
      priest must carry out the god/goddess's wishes. Requirements are:
      Spirit of 13. See Gods of Desova in the Dragonworld Creation section
      for LP.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Races">Races</a></h2>

      They can only be wizards and Rider / fighters.</p>

    <p><strong>Cave Elf:</strong> Cave Elves are elven versions of cavemen. They gain
      a +2 to Strength and a -2 to Magical Ability. Cave Elves can be
      any character type except wizards.</p>

    <p><strong>Dwarf:</strong> Dwarves are short, stout fellows that are fierce miners
      and fighters. They gain a +1 to Dexterity and Strength but a -2
      in Magical Ability. They can be any type except wizards.</p>

    <p><strong>Gargoyle:</strong> Gargoyles are also called Stone Elves because of their
      close resemblance. However, dawn, they become stone until sundown.
      They gain the same ability adjustments as Cave Elves.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Abilities">Ability Scores</a></h2>

    <p><strong>Strength:</strong> Strength is a measure of physical power. </p>

    <p><strong>Magical Ability:</strong> How magically "in tune" you are.</p>

    <p><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Your ability to use your hands.</p>

    <p><strong>Spirit:</strong> A measure of willpower.</p>

    <p><strong>Agility:</strong> Basically, how agile you are.</p>

    <p><strong>Perception:</strong> Your character's eyesight.</p>

    <p><strong>Shapeshifting:</strong> The ability to shapeshift is also recorded.</p>

    <p>Ability scores are used to measure your power. If a player rolls
      all single digits, he / she may roll again. There are three "other"
      scores: Life Points, Armor Class, and Spell Points. Hit Points
      (LP) are determined by character type. Armor Class is determined
      by the type of armor you buy: see COMBAT. Spell Points are determined
      by the following formula:</p>

    <p>((Magical Ability + Spirit) &times; Level) &divide; 5</p>

    <p>An example: Magical Ability 15, Spirit 13, 3rd Level = 84 &divide; 5 =
      17 Spell Points</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Experience">Experience</a></h2>

    <p>In order to advance through levels, a character has to gain experience.
      This experience is recorded with points. For each spell successfully
      used or training received, the character gains experience points.
      The two types of experience are given here:</p>

    <p>Spell Successfully Cast: 10 Experience Points, +5% to Base Chance</p>

    <p>Training: 20 Experience Points</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Combat">Combat</a></h2>

    <p>Combat occurs when characters fight monsters or other characters.
      In combat, opponents are referred to as different "sides".
      It is possible to have several groups fighting each other and
      therefore have more than 2 sides. Combat includes throwing weapons,
      such as rocks, casting spells and meleeing or fighting with handheld
      weapons such as swords. The following sequence is used to resolve
      combat.</p>

    <u>Combat Sequence</u>

    <ol>
      <li>Each side rolls for initiative (1d6).</li>
      <li>The side that wins the initiative acts first.
        <ol>
          <li>Movement per round, meleed opponents may only move defensively.</li>
          <li>Missile fire combat:
            <ol>
              <li>Choose targets</li>
              <li>Both sides roll 3d6 to hit/defend; adjust result by range,
                cover, and magic</li>
              <li>GM rolls damage; adjust result by armor (subtract (AC - 10). Negatives
                become positives (example: -7 means subtract 7 from the damage roll)</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Magic spells</li>
          <li>Melee or hand-to-hand combat:
            <ol>
              <li>Choose (or attacked by) opponents</li>
              <li>Roll 3d6 to hit; adjust result by magic weapons</li>
              <li>GM rolls damage</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>The second initiative winner goes next.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>The GM handles any surrenders, retreats, etc. as they occur.</p>

    <p>Range: For every 20 feet, a penalty of 1 is subtracted from the
      attacker's to hit roll.</p>

    <p>Cover: For every 25%, a penalty of 2 is subtracted from the attacker's
      to hit roll (armor doesn't count).</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Minions"><strong>Minions</strong></a></h2>

    <p>Minions are henchmen, hirelings, people / things that are hired
      to help out their boss. PCs who have hirelings must pay them, unless
      they require no pay. If a PC slays a minion who was a kind or loyal
      person, then the GM should have some sort of punishment for that
      particular PC. OCs who have minions should treat them accordingly;
      if the OC is a monster, half-dinosaur, or humanoid that is evil, then
      the OCs will usually treat the minions with little respect. Good OCs
      will do just the opposite. If a PC wants to hire a minion, he
      / she should post want ads around town. These want ads can either
      be word of mouth or leaf-paper. The ad must include a salary or
      cut of the spoils, as well as a description of all aspects of
      the job. Here is an example:</p>

    <p>Wanted! Loyal partner for raiding expedition. Danger minimum.
      Pay reasonable. Contact Sssrad Darklance for details.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Dragonworld"><strong>Dragonworld Creation</strong></a></h2>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="Howto">How To Build A Dragonworld</a></h3>

    <p>Dragonworlds are the prehistoric worlds in which this game is
      played. They are fairly simple to create, although they sometimes
      can be very difficult to describe. Following is the steps to Dragonworld
      creation.</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Decide on a type of planet: Forest, mountainous, desert, water,
        paradise, etc.</li>
      <li>Describe interesting or important land features, such as volcanoes.</li>
      <li>List the towns, villages, and cities in the Dragonworld.</li>
      <li>List countries, describe their political systems, current ruler(s),
        list allies and enemies, etc.</li>
      <li>List the native gods and their powers.</li>
      <li>Name it.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>See the sample Dragonworld for an idea of how to do this.</p>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="HowtoCastle">How To Build A Dungeon, Castle, Or Keep</a></h3>

    <p>Now these are a little bit trickier. They require a map of some
      sort, unless they are like the Hut of Baba Yaga (they are constantly
      changing). If your dungeon / castle / keep isn't perfect, that's
      OK. It takes time to get good at the art of dungeon creation.
      Here is how to make one:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Make a map.</li>
      <li>Describe every room, cave, and garden on a separate sheet of
        paper.</li>
      <li>Stock the dungeon / castle / keep with monsters, NPCs, treasure,
        and dinosaurs.</li>
      <li>Write an introductory script for the adventure tied to the
        dungeon.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3><a class="anchor" name="HowtoRift">How To Create A Planar Rift</a></h3>

    <p>The planar rifts are gates to other levels of existence. There
      are three known planes: Law, Chaos, and the Neutral Zone. The
      Neutral Zone is the plane where all of the "normal"
      people, dinosaurs, monsters, etc. live. The plane of Law is where
      all good creatures live. The plane of Chaos is where all monsters
      and dragons originated from; it's not necessarily evil, but it
      is far from good. There is at least one unknown plane: the Plane
      of Ethereality. This plane contains nothing as it seems; it is
      the ghost realm. This plane is where the Darkmages, the necromancers,
      obtain the dead souls they work with. Only the Darkmages can open
      a rift to this plane. Now that you know of some of the thousands
      of planes in Vox Draconis, you can go about adding your own rifts
      in your adventures. You simply decide on a point where the two
      planes of your choice intersect, then tear open the fabric of
      space. This "tear", the rift, is the gate between the
      worlds. <strong>Note:</strong> Once the rift is opened, not even the Gamesmaster
      can close it. The only way is to have one of the PCs sacrifice
      his/herself to the rift. Only then will it close.</p>

    <h2><a class="anchor" name="Desova"><strong>The World of Desova: A Beginner's Dragonworld</strong></a></h2>

    <p>Type: Paradise</p>

    <p>Notable Features: The Great Volcano: The nastiest, largest, and
      longest-living volcano ever known.</p>

    <h3>Towns</h3>

    <p><strong>Forestra:</strong> A massive city built in the tops of the trees, to avoid
      the velociraptors known to inhabit the area.</p>

    <p><strong>Oceania:</strong> The "Floating City", as it's sometimes called,
      is a habitat for humans and the occasional wandering pterosaur.</p>

    <p><strong>Mountainia:</strong> This city is built in the face of a steep cliff.</p>

    <p><strong>Desertania:</strong> Actually, Desertania isn't a human city. It's a Gargoyle
      city, which will often appear to be a city of stones (during daylight).</p>

    <h3>Countries</h3>

    <p><strong>Turon:</strong> Ruled by Lord Turosi, this is a dictatorship. Turon's enemies
      consist of all the other countries. It has no allies. Turon's
      people are hateful and hostile to outsiders. Dragons infest this
      country. Its capital is Mountainia.</p>

    <p><strong>Barduche:</strong> The High Council rules Barduche. The Council consists
      of 10 members, all chosen by the Battle of Wits. Only the smartest
      and wisest can be on the High Council. The people of Barduche
      are friendly. The capital of Barduche is Forestra. All other countries,
      except Turon, are its allies. Turon is Barduche's only enemy.</p>

    <p><strong>Dreguar:</strong> A High King, currently Jystre Stonefist II, rules Dreguar.
      He is benevolent, and the people would do anything to support
      him. It is Turon's closest neighbor, and its worst enemy. The
      capital of Dreguar is Desertania. Only Gargoyles and Elves live
      in Dreguar.</p>

    <p><strong>Lystak:</strong> An Archmage rules Lystak. His, or her, identity is never
      revealed. Archmages are chosen from the Schools of Magic, including
      starmages. Lystim has one ally: Barduche. The two countries trade
      often. The Lystakian navy is the largest and deadliest. The capital
      of Lystak is Oceania.</p>

    <p>The world of Desova contains one rift to the Plane of Law
      in the southernmost continent.</p>

    <h3>Castles</h3>

    <p><strong>Dragon Castle:</strong> The home of the evil Lord Turosi, this castle is
      underground. The entrance is a giant cave shaped like a dragon's
      head. Black dragons are often seen guarding the entrance. There
      is a maze of tunnels and caverns below the surface. Only Turosi
      and the natives can navigate it without the aid of a map, which
      cannot be found anywhere on the surface.</p>

    <p><strong>Dawn Palace:</strong> This castle in the city of Desertania is the home
      of the Knights of Solak, the proud Gargoyle and Elven warriors.
      The castle is built out of sandstone. Only the Knights know the
      twisting corridors by heart. Players can become Knights of Solak
      if they are Priests of Solak or Warriors. </p>

    <h3>The Gods of Desova</h3>

    <p><strong>Solak:</strong> The King of Gods. He reigns over most of the gods. Priests
      of Solak have 1d6+2 LP. They also have the power to intimidate
      others (Monsters run on a 5+ on a 1d6).</p>

    <p><strong>Gerodine:</strong> The God of Healing. Priests of Gerodine have 1d6+1 LP
      and can heal anytime for 1d6-2 LP. Must, however, prepare a bundle
      of sacrificial herbs every week. These herbs can be found only
      near waterfalls or Temples of Gerodine.</p>

    <p><strong>Syjham:</strong> The Goddess of Life. Priests of Syjham have 1d6 LP. They
      can resurrect dead animals/people on a roll of 6 on 1d6. Priests
      must also protect life.</p>

    <p><strong>D'Arva:</strong> The God of Evil. This god will kill Priests who are not
      loyal. He will also aid any evil entities in acts of evil. Priests
      of D'Arva have 1d6 LP. They can make and use the Dark Sword, a
      weapon of pure evil. It must be forged at midnight, and cooled
      in the Priest's own blood. Then, it must be enchanted by placing
      a portion of the Priest's Life Force(1d6 Life Points) in the
      sword. This weapon does 4d6+4 damage and does not break. However,
      it may shatter unexpectedly if D'Arva wishes it, along with the
      Priest whom it belongs to.</p>

    <p><strong>Dystrik:</strong> The God of Death. He is very hostile to everyone, except
      Stysk. Dystrik requires a blood sacrifice every month. This sacrifice
      can be any animal or person, except for Gargoyles. He grants his
      priests the ability to use all weapons and armor, and gives them
      bonus magical powers if they kill for him. Priests of Dystrik
      gain 1d6+2 LP.</p>

    <p><strong>Stysk:</strong> The God of War. Stysk stops at nothing to cause war, pain,
      and destruction. Like Dystrik, priests of Stysk gain the use of
      weapons and armor. However, unlike Stysk, Dystrik does not like
      blood sacrifices. In fact, he abhors them. He believes it is a
      waste of life.</p>
