</strong></a>
<p>
Hi, and welcome to Vox Draconis, the game of high adventure in
a somewhat confused world of dinosaurs, dragons, monsters, and
men. The Basic Rules, this book, contains the basic mechanics
for running and playing a game of adventure in the Known Planes.
You only need some six-sided dice, a pencil, paper, and this rulebook
to begin your adventures. This game is a role-playing game, in
which each player creates a character and then, under the supervision
of the games master, or referee, they act them out. <br>

<p>
<a name="HowtoPlay">HOW TO PLAY</a><br>

<p>
Once you have the materials and players for the game, you, the
referee, must have an adventure set up or bought which you will
base your game on. The adventure can be anything from defeating
a giant Tyrannosaurus Rex to sealing an active volcano. The world
of Vox Draconis is a vast one. Once you have the game set up,
your players organized into an adventuring party, and all your
props collected, you can begin. See the section on Dragonworld
Creation for information on building your own worlds. <br>

<p>
THE DICE SYSTEM<br>

<p>
The six-sided dice used in Vox Draconis are referred to in the
rules using this format:<br>

<p>
( Number of dice ) d ( 6, for six-sided die )<br>

<p>
For example, 4d6 means roll the die(dice) 4 times. <br>
<br>
<a name="part2"><strong>Part 2: Character Generation<br>
</strong></a>
<p>
<a name="Character">Creating a character could be an art in itself.
The character that you create is like an incarnation of yourself,
but in a different world, and with different abilities. Before
you make one, you must understand that this character should be
well described, so you &quot;know&quot; the character. Here is
a list of the steps that must be taken to generate a character:
</a><br>

<p>
1. Roll 3d6 for each of your ability scores.
<p>
2. Select a race, and adjust your ability scores accordingly.
<p>
3. Select a character type.
<p>
4. Name the character.
<p>
5. Roll 3d6 x 10 for your starting funds( in Metal Coins )
<p>
6. Describe your character's features, such as sex, weight, height,
eye color, etc.
<p>
7. (OPTIONAL) Write a brief history of your character,<br>

<p>
<a name="Types"><strong>CHARACTER TYPES<br>
<br>
</strong></a>
<p>
<a name="warriors"><u><b>Warriors<br>
</b></u></a>
<p>
Dragon Rider: The Dragon Riders are a proud group. They bond with
a dragon when both are very young. If the dragon is harmed, it
affects its rider considerably. For every 10 dragon Life Points(LP)
lost, the rider loses one. Dragons always have 1d6x10 LP to begin
with, and do 3d6 damage. The rider has 1d6+2 LP. The Prime Requisites
for Dragon Riders are strength and spirit of 13. <br>

<p>
Raptor Rider: Raptor Riders are vicious hunters. They bond with
a raptor when they defeat it in battle. Only 40% of the time will
a character become a Raptor Rider. Raptors have 2d6 x 5 LP, but
do 5d6 damage due to their vicious nature. Raptor Riders have
1d6+2 LP. The Prime Requisite for Raptor Riders is strength of
13.<br>

<p>
<a name="wizards"><u><b>Wizards<br>

LP.<br>

<p>
Starmage: Starmages are actually astronomers with no magical powers.

semi-automatic crossbows which do 2d6 damage. These auto-load
weapons require bolts, though. Starmages also have the ability
to predict the future( 40% chance ). They must have a Perception
score of 15. Starmages have 1d6 LP.
<p>

<p>
<a name="Abilities">ABILITY SCORES</a><br>

<p>
Strength: Strength is a measure of physical power. <br>

<p>
Magical Ability: How magically &quot;in tune&quot; you are.<br>

<p>
Dexterity: Your ability to use your hands.<br>

<p>
Spirit: A measure of willpower.<br>

<p>
Agility: Basically, how agile you are.<br>

<p>
Perception: Your character's eyesight.<br>

<p>
Shapeshifting: The ability to shapeshift is also recorded.<br>

<p>
Ability scores are used to measure your power. If a player rolls
all single digits, he / she may roll again. There are three &quot;other&quot;
scores: Life Points, Armor Class, and Spell Points. Hit Points
( LP ) are determined by character type. Armor Class is determined
by the type of armor you buy: see COMBAT. Spell Points are determined
by the following formula:<br>

<p>
Magical Ability + Spirit * Level / 5 <br>

<p>
An example: Magical Ability 15, Spirit 13, 3rd Level= 84 / 5 =
17 Spell Points <br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="Experience">EXPERIENCE</a><br>

<p>
In order to advance through levels, a character has to gain experience.
This experience is recorded with points. For each spell successfully
used or training received, the character gains experience points.
The two types of experience are given here:<br>

<p>
Spell Successfully Cast: 10 Experience Points, +5% to Base Chance
<p>
Training: 20 Experience Points<br>

<p>
<a name="Combat">COMBAT</a><br>

<p>
Combat occurs when characters fight monsters or other characters.
In combat, opponents are referred to as different &quot;sides&quot;.
It is possible to have several groups fighting each other and
therefore have more than 2 sides. Combat includes throwing weapons,
such as rocks, casting spells and meleeing or fighting with handheld
weapons such as swords. The following sequence is used to resolve
combat.
<p>
<u>Combat Sequence</u>
<p>
A. Each side rolls for initiative ( 1d6 ).
<p>
B. The side that wins the initiative acts first.
<p>
1. Movement per round, meleed opponents may only move defensively.
<p>
2. Missile fire combat:
<p>
a. Choose targets
<p>
b. Both sides roll 3d6 to hit/defend; adjust result by range,
cover, and magic
<p>
c. GM rolls damage; adjust result by armor( subtract ( AC - 10
). Negatives
<p>
become positives( example: -7 means subtract 7 from the damage
roll )
<p>
3. Magic spells
<p>
4. Melee or hand-to-hand combat:
<p>
a. Choose ( or attacked by ) opponents
<p>
b. Roll 3d6 to hit; adjust result by magic weapons
<p>
c. GM rolls damage
<p>
C. The second initiative winner goes next.
<ol>
<li>The GM handles any surrenders, retreats, etc. as they occur.
<br>

</ol>

<p>
Range: For every 20 feet, a penalty of 1 is subtracted from the
attacker's to hit roll.
<p>
Cover: For every 25%, a penalty of 2 is subtracted from the attacker's
to hit roll
<p>
(armor doesn't count)<br>

<p>
<a name="Minions"><b>Minions<br>
</b></a>
<p>
Minions are henchmen, hirelings, people / things that are hired
to help out their boss. PCs
<p>
who have hirelings must pay them, unless they require no pay.
If a PC slays a minion who was a kind or loyal person, then the
GM should have some sort of punishment for that particular PC.
OCs who have minions should treat them accordingly; if the OC
is a monster, half-dinosaur, or humanoid that is evil, then the
OCs will usually treat the minions with little respect. Good OCs
will do just the opposite. If a PC wants to hire a minion, he
/ she should post want ads around town. These want ads can either
be word of mouth or leaf-paper. The ad must include a salary or
cut of the spoils, as well as a description of all aspects of
the job. Here is an example:<br>

<p>
Wanted! Loyal partner for raiding expedition. Danger minimum.
Pay reasonable. Contact Sssrad Darklance for details.<br>

<a name="Dragonworld"><b>Dragonworld Creation<br>
</b></a>
<p>
<a name="Howto">HOW TO BUILD A DRAGONWORLD</a><br>

<p>
Dragonworlds are the prehistoric worlds in which this game is
played. They are fairly simple to create, although they sometimes
can be very difficult to describe. Following is the steps to Dragonworld
creation.<br>

<p>
1. Decide on a type of planet: Forest, mountainous, desert, water,
paradise, etc.
<p>
2. Describe interesting or important land features, such as volcanoes.
<p>
3. List the towns, villages, and cities in the Dragonworld.
<p>
4. List countries, describe their political systems, current ruler(s),
list allies and enemies, etc.
<p>
5. List the native gods and their powers.
<p>
6. Name it.<br>

<p>
See the sample Dragonworld for an idea of how to do this.<br>

<p>
<a name="HowtoCastle">HOW TO BUILD A DUNGEON, CASTLE, OR KEEP</a>
<br>

<p>
Now these are a little bit trickier. They require a map of some
sort, unless they are like the Hut of Baba Yaga( they are constantly
changing ). If your dungeon / castle / keep isn't perfect, that's
OK. It takes time to get good at the art of dungeon creation.
Here is how to make one:<br>

<p>
1. Make a map.
<p>
2. Describe every room, cave, and garden on a separate sheet of
paper.
<p>
3. Stock the dungeon / castle / keep with monsters, NPCs, treasure,
and dinosaurs.
<p>
4. Write an introductory script for the adventure tied to the
dungeon.<br>

<p>
<a name="HowtoRift">HOW TO CREATE A PLANAR RIFT</a><br>

<p>
The planar rifts are gates to other levels of existence. There
are three known planes: Law, Chaos, and the Neutral Zone. The
Neutral Zone is the plane where all of the &quot;normal&quot;
people, dinosaurs, monsters, etc. live. The plane of Law is where
all good creatures live. The plane of Chaos is where all monsters
and dragons originated from; it's not necessarily evil, but it
is far from good. There is at least one unknown plane: the Plane
of Ethereality. This plane contains nothing as it seems; it is
the ghost realm. This plane is where the Darkmages, the necromancers,
obtain the dead souls they work with. Only the Darkmages can open
a rift to this plane. Now that you know of some of the thousands
of planes in Vox Draconis, you can go about adding your own rifts
in your adventures. You simply decide on a point where the two
planes of your choice intersect, then tear open the fabric of
space. This &quot;tear&quot;, the rift, is the gate between the
worlds. Note: Once the rift is opened, not even the Gamesmaster
can close it. The only way is to have one of the PCs sacrifice
his / herself to the rift. Only then will it close. <br>

<p>
<a name="Desova"><b>The World of Desova: A Beginner's Dragonworld</b>
<br>
</a>
<p>
Type: Paradise
<p>
Notable Features: The Great Volcano: The nastiest, largest, and
longest-living volcano ever known.
<p>
<u>Towns</u>
<p>
Forestra- A massive city built in the tops of the trees, to avoid
the velociraptors known to inhabit the area.
<p>
Oceania- The &quot;Floating City&quot;, as it's sometimes called,
is a habitat for humans and the occasional wandering pterosaur.
<p>
Mountainia- This city is built in the face of a steep cliff. 
<p>
Desertania- Actually, Desertania isn't a human city. It's a Gargoyle
city, which will often appear to be a city of stones( during daylight
).<br>

<p>
<u>Countries</u>
<p>
Turon: Ruled by Lord Turosi, this is a dictatorship. Turon's enemies
consist of all the other countries. It has no allies. Turon's
people are hateful and hostile to outsiders. Dragons infest this
country. Its capital is Mountainia.
<p>
Barduche: The High Council rules Barduche. The Council consists
of 10 members, all chosen by the Battle of Wits. Only the smartest
and wisest can be on the High Council. The people of Barduche
are friendly. The capital of Barduche is Forestra. All other countries,
except Turon, are its allies. Turon is Barduche's only enemy.
<p>
Dreguar: A High King, currently Jystre Stonefist II, rules Dreguar.
He is benevolent, and the people would do anything to support
him. It is Turon's closest neighbor, and its worst enemy. The
capital of Dreguar is Desertania. Only Gargoyles and Elves live
in Dreguar.
<p>
Lystak: An Archmage rules Lystak. His, or her, identity is never
revealed. Archmages are chosen from the Schools of Magic, including
starmages. Lystim has one ally: Barduche. The two countries trade
often. The Lystakian navy is the largest and deadliest. The capital
of Lystak is Oceania.<br>

<p>
Notes: The world of Desova contains one rift to the Plane of Law
in the southernmost continent.<br>

<p>
<u>Castles</u>
<p>
Dragon Castle: The home of the evil Lord Turosi, this castle is
underground. The entrance is a giant cave shaped like a dragon's
head. Black dragons are often seen guarding the entrance. There
is a maze of tunnels and caverns below the surface. Only Turosi
and the natives can navigate it without the aid of a map, which
cannot be found anywhere on the surface. <br>

<p>
Dawn Palace: This castle in the city of Desertania is the home
of the Knights of Solak, the proud Gargoyle and Elven warriors.
The castle is built out of sandstone. Only the Knights know the
twisting corridors by heart. Players can become Knights of Solak
if they are Priests of Solak or Warriors. <br>
<br>

<p>
<u>The Gods of Desova</u>
<p>
Solak: The King of Gods. He reigns over most of the gods. Priests
of Solak have 1d6+2 LP. They also have the power to intimidate
others ( Monsters run on a 5+ on a 1d6 ).
<p>
Gerodine: The God of Healing. Priests of Gerodine have 1d6+1 LP
and can heal anytime for 1d6-2 LP. Must, however, prepare a bundle
of sacrificial herbs every week. These herbs can be found only
near waterfalls or Temples of Gerodine.
<p>
Syjham: The Goddess of Life. Priests of Syjham have 1d6 LP. They
can resurrect dead animals/people on a roll of 6 on 1d6. Priests
must also protect life.
<p>
D'Arva: The God of Evil. This god will kill Priests who are not
loyal. He will also aid any evil entities in acts of evil. Priests
of D'Arva have 1d6 LP. They can make and use the Dark Sword, a
weapon of pure evil. It must be forged at midnight, and cooled
in the Priest's own blood. Then, it must be enchanted by placing
a portion of the Priest's Life Force( 1d6 Life Points ) in the
sword. This weapon does 4d6+4 damage and does not break. However,
it may shatter unexpectedly if D'Arva wishes it, along with the
Priest whom it belongs to.
<p>
Dystrik: The God of Death. He is very hostile to everyone, except
Stysk. Dystrik requires a blood sacrifice every month. This sacrifice
can be any animal or person, except for Gargoyles. He grants his
priests the ability to use all weapons and armor, and gives them
bonus magical powers if they kill for him. Priests of Dystrik
gain 1d6+2 LP. 
<p>
Stysk: The God of War. Stysk stops at nothing to cause war, pain,
and destruction. Like Dystrik, priests of Stysk gain the use of
weapons and armor. However, unlike Stysk, Dystrik does not like
blood sacrifices. In fact, he abhors them. He believes it is a
waste of life.<br>
