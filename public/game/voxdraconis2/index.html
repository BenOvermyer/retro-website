  <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p><em>Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire</em> is my latest tabletop role-playing game project. Thematically, it’s based on my original <a href="vd.html">Vox Draconis</a> game. It’s not set in the original game’s “Desova” setting, but it takes a few cues from that world. Dinosaurs are as prevalent as other wildlife. The tech level is somewhere between the Stone Age and Tolkienesque fantasy. The game system makes a few nods to the original’s, but is built around the player characters being true heroes and not rampaging murderhobo tomb raiders.</p>
<p>“Treasure” as older tabletop role-playing games define it is much less of a focus. Experience Points are awarded for having an impact on the game world, and not explicitly for defeating monsters. It is perfectly plausible to run a campaign where no combat takes place. Such a game might focus on the social intrigues of a noble court, or perhaps the misadventures of a group of street performers. This is up to you.</p>
<p>The game is still very rough. I will post the rules here in PDF form when it’s playable and iterate from there. For the time being, the unfinished manuscript is posted below.</p>
<h1 id="character-creation">Character Creation</h1>
<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>
<p>Every character has the following attributes. These define their physical, mental, social, and magical capabilities.</p>
<p>There are four categories: Physical, Mental, Social, and Arcane. Each category has the following attributes.</p>
<p><strong>Strength:</strong> Offensive ability or power.</p>
<p><strong>Endurance:</strong> Defensive ability or resistance.</p>
<p><strong>Dexterity:</strong> Manipulative ability or agility.</p>
<p>In total, there are twelve attributes. For brevity’s sake, sometimes you will see references to abbreviations of these attributes. These abbreviations will always have the first letter of the category and the first letter of the attribute. So, Physical Strength would be abbreviated PS, and Arcane Endurance would be abbreviated AE.</p>
<p>At the beginning of character creation, determine the value of each attribute. Choose one of the two scoring methods below.</p>
<h3 id="random-method">Random Method</h3>
<p>You can determine attributes randomly. To do this, roll 3d6 and add 2 to the total. The result is the score for an attribute. Repeat this for every attribute.</p>
<h3 id="point-buy-method">Point-Buy Method</h3>
<p>For a more balanced approach, you can instead use the point-buy method. In this method, you have 120 points to allocate among the attributes. No attribute can be over 14 or under 8 when using point-buy.</p>
<h2 id="choose-two-ancestries">Choose Two Ancestries</h2>
<p>Pick two ancestries. This will give you several innate abilities and a piece of your character’s background.</p>
<h2 id="choose-a-class">Choose a Class</h2>
<p>Pick a class. This will determine your path in life and which abilities you have refined.</p>
<h2 id="choose-an-attunement">Choose an Attunement</h2>
<p>Pick an attunement. This will grant you a supernatural ability and an affinity for a supernatural force. Be warned: that affinity will be both a boon and a weakness.</p>
<h2 id="derived-statistics">Derived Statistics</h2>
<p>After all the above is accounted for, calculate your derived statistics. These are Life Points and Crisis Points. Life Points determine how much damage your character can take before falling unconscious. Crisis Points determine how many times your character can narrowly avoid disaster. They are calculated as follows.</p>
<p><strong>Life Points:</strong> Physical Endurance + 5</p>
<p><strong>Crisis Points:</strong> (Mental Endurance + Physical Endurance + Social Endurance + Arcane Endurance) / 4 (round down)</p>
<h2 id="starting-equipment">Starting Equipment</h2>
<p>Your character begins play with 50 silver drachms, the coinage of the realm. You must spend at least half of it on equipment from the Equipment chapter.</p>
<h1 id="character-advancement">Character Advancement</h1>
<p>As you play, the Game Master will give you Experience Points. You can spend them between game sessions on Developments. See the Developments chapter for more information.</p>
<p>Characters never gain more Life Points. To increase their durability, they must find new ways to protect themselves.</p>
<p>New Crisis Points can be gained by spending Experience Points. Each Crisis Point costs 10 Experience Points.</p>
<h1 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h1>
<p>The flow of gameplay runs in turns. The Game Master will describe a scene, and then players take turns describing what they do. In combat, turns are more structured, and each enemy has a separate turn.</p>
<h2 id="turn-order">Turn Order</h2>
<p>Outside of combat, turns can occur in whatever order fits the scene. In combat, players act in Initiative order. At the beginning of combat, each player rolls a twenty-sided die, adds their Physical Dexterity, and tells the Game Master the result. The GM rolls Initiative for each NPC involved in combat, too. All characters – whether player or NPC – act in descending order according to their Initiative scores. If two or more characters have the same Initiative score, they are acting simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>
<p>In a turn, a character can do one major action and one minor action. Major actions include casting a spell, attacking, setting a trap, or any other action that takes the character’s full attention. A minor action includes movement, swapping equipped weapons, or other things that the character can do while doing major actions.</p>
<p>Most of the time, an action is going to require an attribute roll. The player rolls a twenty-sided die and tries to get under the relevant attribute score. The number they must roll under may be modified by skills or by the difficulty of the task.</p>
<h2 id="crisis-rolls">Crisis Rolls</h2>
<p>If a player ever gets into a situation that would have dire consequences for them, they may make a Crisis Roll to avoid it. They roll a twenty-sided die, and if the roll is over 10, they succeed. If they fail, they must spend a Crisis Point to avoid their fate. If they don’t have any Crisis Points to spend, the consequences fall on them.</p>
<p>A Crisis Roll may be used for such things as avoiding death or negating the result of a social engagement.</p>
<h2 id="the-passage-of-time">The Passage of Time</h2>
<p>In combat, a turn lasts roughly 5 seconds of in-game time. Outside of combat, a turn takes as much or as little in-game time as the scene demands.</p>
<h2 id="combat">Combat</h2>
<p>The following rules govern how combat works.</p>
<h3 id="attacking-and-defending">Attacking and Defending</h3>
<p>A character’s Defense score is equal to the sum of Armor Points they have.</p>
<p>When a character attacks, they roll a twenty-sided die and add their Physical Dexterity. If the result is higher than the defender’s Defense score, the attack hits.</p>
<h3 id="damage">Damage</h3>
<p>A successful hit deals damage equal to the amount specified by the weapon. Melee weapons deal an extra 2 damage if the character’s Physical Strength is over 15.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>
<p>If a character’s Life Points reach zero or less, they fall unconscious. When this happens, the character must make a Crisis Roll. If they fail, they must spend a Crisis Point to stay alive. If the roll is successful or they spend the Crisis Point, they don’t need to continue rolling, and the character stabilizes but remains unconscious.</p>
<h2 id="social-engagements">Social Engagements</h2>
<p>A social engagement is a conversation of importance between two or more sides. Before it begins, divide the participants into sides. Every participant will argue for their side. Each side determines what they’re arguing for before the engagement begins.</p>
<p>Much like combat, each participant has a turn. On their turn, they may choose to take one of the following actions, or give up their turn for the round. Every social engagement lasts for three rounds. At the end of the three rounds, the total points of each side is compared, and the highest wins. In the event of a tie, there is no victor, and the engagement is a draw.</p>
<p>Once the engagement is over, the GM determines the result of the winning argument.</p>
<h3 id="persuade">Persuade</h3>
<p>This is an attempt to convince another participant of the correctness of your argument. Roll a twenty-sided die and add your Social Strength. If it is higher than the other participant’s Social Endurance, you gain a point for your side.</p>
<h3 id="dissuade">Dissuade</h3>
<p>You can try and reduce the points of another participant’s side. Roll a twenty-sided die and add your Social Dexterity. If it is higher than the other participant’s Social Dexterity, their side loses a point. That side cannot go below zero points.</p>
<h3 id="riposte">Riposte</h3>
<p>Instead of taking a direct action, you can complicate the result of the entire engagement by making a Riposte. Roll a twenty-sided die and add your Social Dexterity. If the result is higher than 10, then regardless of the result of the social engagement, there will be a complication. The GM chooses the complication.</p>
<h2 id="experience-points">Experience Points</h2>
<p>This is the reward that allows player characters to grow in ability. The Game Master gives out Experience Points at the end of a session based on the players’ actions during the session. Experience Points can be awarded for any action by the player characters that has a noticeable impact on the game world.</p>
<h2 id="player-points">Player Points</h2>
<p>While characters can gain in power as a reward for their active participation in the game world, players should also gain a reward for improving the game experience for everyone. The reward for this is Player Points. Any player at the table, not just the Game Master, can give these out. However, only one can be received by each player per session.</p>
<p>Player Points can be spent to alter or enhance the player character’s backstory, appearance, or other aspects of the character outside of their game mechanics. The Game Master should use their discretion in determining the cost of such changes.</p>
<h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>
<p>Magic is a force both intrinsically linked to the world and wholly separate from it. It is the root of all creation, all destruction, all life, and all death. It is also a force unto itself. Some beings exhibit unusual abilities born of it. Others learn how to manipulate its links to the world in order to have some small control over it.</p>
<p>Despite its omnipresence, magic does not manifest strongly in the world. There are no spell-casters in the traditional sense. In game terms, characters will only ever have a handful of pre-defined magical abilities at most.</p>
<h1 id="classes">Classes</h1>
<p>The following are the classes of Vox Draconis. They are professions, followings, or other life pursuits.</p>
<h2 id="dragon-bonded">Dragon-Bonded</h2>
<p>If a child is present when a dragon’s egg hatches, there is a small chance that the hatchling and the child will form a supernatural and unbreakable bond. The Illdrazi have built their entire culture around this phenomenon, and co-exist in peace with dragons.</p>
<p>A dragon-bonded’s life is built around that bond, for better or worse. They live with, hunt with, grow old with, and die with their dragon.</p>
<p>At character creation, choose one of the dragon types from the Creatures, Enemies, and Allies chapter. You gain a dragon bond-mate of that type. They will listen to you and usually do as asked, but are not mindless servants and have goals of their own. Consider the personality of your bond-mate.</p>
<h3 id="dragon-bonded-abilities">Dragon-Bonded Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Life:</strong> You are bonded to a single dragon for life. If your bond-mate dies, you must make a Crisis Roll. If you fail and cannot spend a Crisis Point, you also die. However, you also gain the lifespan of your dragon, and will not die of old age until they do.</li>
<li><strong>Telepathic Link:</strong> You can communicate with your bond-mate in words and images, no matter how much distance is between you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="raptor-bonded">Raptor-Bonded</h2>
<p>The Ardonans are fierce tribal warriors whose lives revolve around fighting. They live in the jungles of Ardona, home to many equally fierce beasts. Among these are the greater raptors - bipedal carnivorous dinosaurs the size of a horse. When a clutch of greater raptor eggs hatch, a tribe of Ardonans will sometimes steal the hatchlings and raise them alongside their young.</p>
<p>Often, a raptor hatchling and a child will form a supernatural bond. Once this occurs, the bond lasts until one of them dies.</p>
<p>The raptor-bonded and their bond-mate hunt, fight, and live together. Groups of Ardonan raptor-bonded will hunt as packs and are deeply loyal to each other.</p>
<h3 id="raptor-bonded-abilities">Raptor-Bonded Abilities</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared Senses:</strong> If you concentrate, you can share all of the senses of your bond-mate. You can only do this for a few seconds before needing to break the link, and you can only do it once every hour. The senses of your bond-mate replace your own for the duration.</li>
<li><strong>Empathic Link:</strong> You can communicate with your bond-mate in emotions and images, no matter how much distance is between you.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="silver-tongue">Silver Tongue</h2>
<h2 id="beast-master">Beast Master</h2>
<h1 id="ancestries">Ancestries</h1>
<p>These are the ancestries of Vox Draconis. At character creation you will pick two of these to represent your character’s parentage. You may pick the same ancestry twice. Once you have chosen your ancestries, pick one Major Aspect and two Minor Aspects from their lists. The Major Aspect comes from the general ancestries, and the Minor Aspects come from the specific ancestries.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Alex decides his character’s ancestries will be Coastal Human and Plains Human. She chooses the Major Aspect of <em>Resilient</em> from the Human list, and then the Minor Aspects of <em>Exceptional Swimmer</em> and <em>Natural Rider</em> from the Coastal Human and Plains Human lists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Pairings that are biologically incompatible are assumed to have occurred magically or through other supernatural means.</p>
<h2 id="human">Human</h2>
<h3 id="human-major-aspects">Human Major Aspects</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Resilient:</strong> Automatically succeed on all Crisis Rolls. You still must spend a Crisis Point each time.</li>
<li><strong>Adaptable:</strong> Once per combat or social engagement, you may reroll any roll. You must accept the second result.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="coastal-human">Coastal Human</h3>
<p>Coastal humans tend towards bronzed skin, dark hair, and smaller builds.</p>

<h1 id="attunements">Attunements</h1>
<p>The entries below are the attunements of Vox Draconis. You may never have more than one attunement.</p>
<p>An attunement is a supernatural alignment to a particular constellation or heavenly body. It is rare among mortals, affecting only 1 in 10,000. Those born with an attunement are destined for great and sometimes terrible things. Some animals also have attunements, though that is even rarer than among sentient beings.</p>
