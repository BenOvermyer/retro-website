<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>My first game I ever wrote was a pitiful boardgame somewhere around 1992
that wasn't even typed. Now, I have an RPG published on the Web. Now,
while I like that game, it is remarkably similar to Dungeons and
Dragons. If you like that kind of game, go see <a href="vd.html">Vox Draconis</a>.</p>
<p>This game is nothing like any existing system. I have tried to be as
original as possible. Also, I tried to keep it short, since I really
hate reading 200+ pages of rules before finally understanding how to
roll attributes. If you have any questions or comments, please <a href="mailto:ben@overmyer.net">email
me</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks for trying out my game.</p>
<h1 id="character-generation">Character Generation</h1>
<h2 id="dice-explanation">Dice Explanation</h2>
<p>%dice is used a great deal throughout the game. To roll %dice, roll two
ten-sided dice, with one of the numbers being the first digit and the
other number as the second digit. 00 represents 100.</p>
<h2 id="rolling-attributes">Rolling Attributes</h2>
<p>Roll %dice for each.</p>
<ul>
<li>Intelligence</li>
<li>Manual Dexterity</li>
<li>Physical Strength</li>
<li>Willpower</li>
<li>Endurance</li>
<li>Physical Beauty</li>
<li>Charisma</li>
<li>Agility</li>
<li>Perception</li>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Bravery</li>
<li>Magical Aptitude</li>
</ul>
<p>Roll 1d20 for Life Force Points, then multiply them times the Endurance
score, and modify them according to character race and occupation.
Example: Endurance 57, occupation Knight, race human - (0.57 × 16(1d20
result)) × 1.5 = 14 LFP.</p>
<h2 id="skill-system">Skill System</h2>
<p>Think up a skill that your character has, then have the GM assign a
percentage value for it.</p>
<p>When you try to use that skill, roll %dice. If the value you roll is
lower than the percentage value of the skill, then you succeed at
whatever you're doing. If the value of the roll is higher than the
percentage value of the skill, then you fail, and you mess up what
you're doing in some way(Gamemaster determines).</p>
<p>NOTE: When creating a new character, you can have a maximum number of
skills equal to your Intelligence divided by 5, rounding up.</p>
<h2 id="experience-system">Experience System</h2>
<p>Experience in the Iridium system is given as player characters complete
tasks. Experience is given in categories:</p>
<h3 id="intellectual-categories">Intellectual Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Wisdom</li>
<li>Problem Solving</li>
<li>Education</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="physical-categories">Physical Categories</h3>
<ul>
<li>Manual Work</li>
<li>Muscle Development</li>
<li>Reflexes</li>
</ul>
<p>When a task is completed, the Gamemaster will assign a certain amount of
points to the player that goes into a particular category. When a
category reaches 100 points, it is reset to 0 and the player can obtain
a new skill related to that category, or the player can improve an old
skill by 1d10%, but it has to be related to the experience category. It
is recommended that the Gamemaster use this table to assign experience
points:</p>
<p>Task Difficulty   Points Given</p>
<hr>
<p>Very Easy         1
Easy              2
Average           3
Hard              4
Very Hard         5
Heroic            6</p>
<p>Also, instead of improving a skill or getting a new one, you can add to
your LFP. Roll 1d10.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: Drygar Farseer attempts to leap across a narrow canyon, grab a
vine in the center, and swing across to the other side. The Gamemaster
determines that this is a Very Hard task (Drygar has a Manual Dexterity
score of 46% and an Agility score of 21%, as well as a Jump skill of
37%). Drygar successfully rolls against both scores and his skill, so he
completes the task. He gains 5 experience points and divides them up
between his Manual Work and Reflexes categories. This brings his
Reflexes score to 100, so he resets the category and improves his Jump
skill by 7%(he rolled a 7 on the 1d10%). He now has a Jump skill of 44%.</p>
<h2 id="weapons-experience">Weapons Experience</h2>
<p>When a character uses a weapon, he will gain experience as well. Unlike
character experience, weapon experience is given in levels.When a weapon
is used, the wielder will gain 1 weapon experience point. This point
goes into that weapon's experience cache. When the cache reaches 50,
then the weapon goes up a level and the cache is reset. As weapon level
increases, the character can perform more difficult maneuvers with less
difficulty. Use this table for such maneuvers:</p>
<p>Maneuver Difficulty         Base Chance of Success   Damage Modifier</p>
<hr>
<p>Very Easy (stab)            70%                      -1
Easy (parry)                55%                      0
Average (overhead smash)    40%                      +1
Hard (Fake, then thrust)    25%                      ×2
Very Hard (Death blow)      10%                      ×3
Heroic (Whirlwind Strike)   1%                       ×4</p>
<p>For each new weapon level, the character gains 1d20% in that weapon's
chance of success. All weapons start at Level 1.</p>
<p>EXAMPLE: Drygar Farseer tries to smash an orc over the head with his
mace. Normally, this would be a 40% chance, but since Drygar is Level 3
with the mace, he has a 75% chance (he rolled 18 at Level 2 and 17 at
level 3). He rolls versus the chance and gets a 23 - a complete success.
Now the orc has a chance to deflect the blow; see Combat.</p>
<h2 id="races">Races</h2>
<p>Races play an important part of the game. Each one has advantages and
disadvantages.</p>
<h3 id="human">Human</h3>
<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> None</p>
<p><strong>Penalties:</strong> None</p>
<p>Humans are the most common race in Iridium Fantasy. They tend to be
aggressive, but not overly so. Humans are usually about 5'6&quot; tall and
weigh 160 lbs.</p>
<p>Subspecies:</p>
<p>None</p>
<h3 id="elf">Elf</h3>
<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> +5% to Intelligence, +5% to Manual Dexterity, +5% to
Perception</p>
<p><strong>Penalties:</strong> -15% to Physical Strength</p>
<p>Elves are also known as the Fey. They are short(about 4'5&quot; avg.) and
have pointed ears. They have excellent sight and are among the best
archers in the world. They are also light(about 80 lbs).</p>
<p>Subspecies:</p>
<h4 id="noble-elf">Noble Elf</h4>
<p>Noble elves are those of royal blood. They rule over all the other
elves. Unlike other elves, they are arrogant and will occasionally(40%
chance) irritate someone beyond the limit, at which time that someone
will probably take violent action against the elf. Noble elves are
taller than others(5' avg.). They will tend to wear expensive clothing
and gain a +1d20 bonus to starting money. Noble elves cannot be
warriors.</p>
<h4 id="wood-elf">Wood Elf</h4>
<p>Wood elves are the woodland species of elf. They are very quiet when in
the woods(RACIAL SKILL: Move Silently: Woods 45%). They are never
arrogant, although they are extremely wary of nonelven races. Wood elves
tend to be dressed in handmade forestcolored clothing(like deerhide
jackets, etc.). They are best suited as scouts or wardens(+1 to
experience earned if the wood elf is a scout or warden).</p>
<h4 id="sand-elf">Sand Elf</h4>
<p>Sand elves, or desert elves as they are called by humans, are the most
enigmatic of the elves. They do not obey laws set out by noble elves.
Sand elves have a nomadic social structure based on family groups, or
clans. They are very hard to spot in the desert(RACIAL SKILL:
Invisibility: Desert 65%). Rarely will a sand elf leave the desert. They
have a dark complexion and dress in sand-colored clothing.</p>
<h4 id="dark-elf">Dark Elf</h4>
<p>Dark elves are the most dangerous of elves. Like the sand elves, they
don't obey noble elf laws. Unlike the other elves, dark elves live
underground. They hate sunlight(-10% to all rolls when in sunlight).
Dark elves have black skin, white hair, and red or dark purple eyes.
They wear clothing made of black hide that is believed to come from an
unknown type of predator that lives deep underground. Dark elves will
ALWAYS be of an evil alignment, and are hated by all other elves. They
can, however, see in the dark(RACIAL SKILL: Nightvision 50%).</p>
<h3 id="dwarf">Dwarf</h3>
<p><strong>Bonuses:</strong> +10% to Manual Dexterity, RACIAL SKILL: Craft Weapon: Axe
45%, +1d4 LFP</p>
<p><strong>Penalties:</strong> -100% to Magical Aptitude! Dwarves CANNOT use magic!</p>
<p>Dwarves are short, stocky fellows. They love metal, and they are
recognized as the world's greatest smiths. They tend to be about 5'
tall and weigh around 180 lbs.</p>
<p>Subspecies:</p>
<h4 id="mountain-dwarf">Mountain Dwarf</h4>
<p>Mountain dwarves are the most common type of dwarf. They live
underground in mountains. They are the greatest smiths of all the
dwarven race(RACIAL SKILL: Craft Weapon or Craft Armor 55%) Mountain
dwarves are friendly to all other dwarves except the shadow dwarves.
They usually dress in leather and rough cloth.</p>
<h4 id="plains-dwarf">Plains Dwarf</h4>
<p>Plains dwarves are the only type of dwarf that live above ground. They
love the sunlight and build large cities. Like mountain dwarves, they
HATE shadow dwarves(40% chance of attacking a shadow dwarf on sight).
Plains dwarves are taller than other dwarves(about 5'3&quot;), but weigh
about the same. They appreciate worldly goods, and usually dress in
light, fine cloth.</p>
<h4 id="shadow-dwarf">Shadow Dwarf</h4>
<p>Shadow dwarves are the dwarven equivalent of dark elves. They hold a
fierce hatred of all other dwarves, and will(100% chance) attack any kin
they see(this includes other shadow dwarves). They have no social
structure, but seem to be able to control some part of their evil
nature. Unlike dark elves, they are not completely ruled by evil. Shadow
dwarves dress in black and dark grey clothing. Their hair is usually a
pale grey to white, and their eyes are black. They have pale gray skin.</p>

<li>Weight</li>

<li>Parents (1 dead, both dead, both alive, or unknown to character)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>
<p>As explained above, all weapons have a maneuver chance of success. When
a roll is successful, then the user hits the target. However, the target
can ALSO roll weapon maneuver to block the attack. If the target still
fails, then the attacker rolls the damage of the weapon. If the target
is wearing armor, then the armor will take the damage before the
target(roll maneuver chance of success for armor as well, and if the
result is less than the percent of the attack's chance of success, then
the armor is breached and the target takes damage. If the result is more
than said percent, then the armor is strong enough to deflect the
attack) if the armor roll is successful. Each type of armor has an
amount of armor points that are taken away when damage is done to the
armor.</p>
<p>When a character's(player or nonplayer) Life Force Points reaches 0,
the character is knocked unconscious. When the character's LFP reaches
-5, the character is killed. Killed characters cannot be healed.</p>
<p><strong>Example Of Combat:</strong> Continuing Drygar's battle with the orc:</p>
<p>The orc failed his roll to deflect Drygar's attack, so now he takes
damage. Drygar rolls a 4 on 1d6(the mace's damage roll). The orc is
wearing leather armor, which has 5 Armor Points. It fails its armor
roll.</p>
<p>That leaves the orc with only 1 Armor Point remaining.</p>
<p>Time for retaliation! The orc rolls to hit Drygar, getting a 53%.
However, since the orc was attempting an Average maneuver, he misses
Drygar completely. Drygar brings his mace around again, and successfully
rolls to hit the orc with a Hard maneuver. The orc tries to block the
attack. He needs a 24%. Rolls.&hellip;the orc gets a 21%, successfully
blocking the attack. Now the orc strikes again, this time successfully.
He also manages to get past Drygar's blocking attempt, and his armor
roll, and rolls 1d8 (scimitar damage), getting an 8! Drygar has chain
mail, which has 20 Armor Points. The chain mail is reduced to 12 Armor
Points. Drygar's counterattack hits and gets past the orc's block, and
his armor roll, and Drygar rolls damage again. This time he gets a 5,
and destroys the orc's armor. Also, he knocks the orc unconscious,
since he only had 4 LFP. Unwilling to be attacked again, Drygar rolls to
hit, the orc fails its armor roll, and Drygar rolls damage (no blocking
roll), getting a 6 and killing the orc.</p>
<h1 id="magic">Magic</h1>
<p>Magic in the Iridium system is handled in this way: The mage's player
rolls To Tap first, to determine if he can tap the natural energies
flowing around him.</p>
<h2 id="to-tap">To Tap</h2>
<p>Roll against the mage's Use Magic skill. If this is successful, then
the mage taps the energy.</p>
<h2 id="casting">Casting</h2>
<p>The second step in using magic is to determine what the mage is trying
to do. For the example, I will use a pyromancer as the mage. He wants to
create a wall of fire in front of a cave. The Gamemaster then determines
what Skill Level this spell is at, and the character uses his Arcane
Knowledge modifier and rolls against his Use Magic score. Here are the
tables mentioned:</p>
<p>Skill Level   Use Magic Modifier</p>
<hr>
<p>Very Easy     +20%
Easy          +10%
Average       0
Hard          -10%
Very Hard     -20%
Heroic        -40%</p>
<p>Arcane Knowledge   Percentage Modifier</p>
<hr>
<p>1-20%              -20%
21-40%             -10%
41-60%             0
61-80%             +10%
81-99%             +20%
100%               +30%</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> Lorith Nightaxe, a pyromancer, wants to cover a cave
entrance with a wall of fire. The Gamemaster decides this is a Hard
task, since the cave opening is rather large. Lorith has an Arcane
Knowledge: Pyromancy score of 56%. With the modifiers, it becomes 46%.
Lorith rolls a 67%, failing the spell.</p>
<h3 id="spell-failures">Spell Failures</h3>
<p>If a spell isn't completed, but the energy was tapped, then check this
table to see what happens:</p>
<p>Failure Intensity   Effect</p>
<hr>
<p>1-30% off           No effect; energy dissipates
31-50% off          Spell backfires and hits caster with 1/4 normal effects
51-60% off          Spell backfires and hits caster with 1/2 normal effects
61-70% off          Spell backfires and hits caster with full effects
71+% off            FEEDBACK! Energy does <em>4 × effects</em> to everything within 3d20 yards of caster(including caster)</p>
<h3 id="spell-experience">Spell Experience</h3>
<p>When a spell is successfully completed, the caster recieves Spell
Experience. Like other experience, when it reaches 100 it is reset and
the character can modify things.</p>
<p>Spell experience can be used to add to either his Arcane Knowledge or
Use Magic skill. It cannot be used to gain new skills, unless the new
skill is related to the caster's field of magic. EXAMPLE: A new skill
for a terramancer might be Detect Rock Ins tability. However, Spell
Experience may be used to add to Life Force Points. The caster may add
1d10 LFP every time his spell experience is upgraded.</p>

<h2 id="monster-creation">Monster Creation</h2>
<p>Since the Iridium system is based on customization, I will leave all
monster creation up to you. For now. If this game receives enough
attention, I will write a Sourcebook for it that will have a monster
list in it, as well as many other things that I may forget to add in
this edition. For now, use this format to create monsters:</p>
<p>Name: Monster's name</p>
<p>LFP: Life Force Points, in dice(2d6, 1d8, etc.)</p>
<p>Size: Monster's size in height, width, and length</p>
<p>Weight: Monster's weight</p>
<p>Speed: Monster's maximum speed in feet per second</p>
<p>Attacks: Monster's types of attacks, and damage rolls</p>
<p>Special Abilities: Special abilities such as nightvision, telepathy,
etc.</p>
<p>Movement Type: Flight, slither, etc.</p>
<p>Appearance: A description of the monster's appearance</p>
