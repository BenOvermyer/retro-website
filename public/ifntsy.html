        <h1>Iridium Fantasy</h1>
        <p>Written and Designed by Ben Overmyer</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>My first game I ever wrote was a pitiful boardgame somewhere around 1992 that wasn't even typed. Now, I have
            an
            RPG
            published on the Web. Now, while I like that game, it is remarkably similar to Dungeons and Dragons. If you
            like
            that kind of game, go see <a href="vd.html">Vox Draconis</a>.</p>
        <p>This game is nothing like any existing system. I have tried to be as original as possible. Also, I tried to
            keep
            it short, since I really hate reading 200+ pages of rules before finally understanding how to roll
            attributes.
            If you have any questions or comments, please <a href="mailto:ben@overmyer.net">email me</a>.</p>
        <p>Thanks for trying out my game.</p>

        <h2>Character Generation</h2>

        <h3>Dice Explanation</h3>

        <p>%dice is used a great deal throughout the game. To roll %dice, roll two ten-sided dice, with one of the
            numbers
            being the first digit and the other number as the second digit. 00 represents 100.</p>

        <h3>Rolling Attributes</h3>

        <p>Roll %dice for each.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Intelligence</li>
            <li>Manual Dexterity</li>
            <li>Physical Strength</li>
            <li>Willpower</li>
            <li>Endurance</li>
            <li>Physical Beauty</li>
            <li>Charisma</li>
            <li>Agility</li>
            <li>Perception</li>
            <li>Speed</li>
            <li>Bravery</li>
            <li>Magical Aptitude</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Roll 1d20 for Life Force Points, then multiply them times the Endurance score, and modify them according to
            character race and occupation. Example: Endurance 57, occupation Knight, race human - (0.57 &times; 16(1d20
            result)) &times;
            1.5 = 14 LFP.</p>

        <h3>Skill System</h3>

        <p>Think up a skill that your character has, then have the GM assign a percentage value for it.</p>
        <p>When you try to use that skill, roll %dice. If the value you roll is lower than the percentage value of the
            skill, then you succeed at whatever you're doing. If the value of the roll is higher than the percentage
            value
            of the skill, then you fail, and
            you mess up what you're doing in some way(Gamemaster determines).</p>
        <p>NOTE: When creating a new character, you can have a maximum number of skills equal to your Intelligence
            divided
            by 5, rounding up.</p>

        <h3>Experience System</h3>

        <p>Experience in the Iridium system is given as player characters complete tasks. Experience is given in
            categories:
        </p>

        <h4>Intellectual Categories</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Wisdom</li>
            <li>Problem Solving</li>
            <li>Education</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Physical Categories</h4>

        <ul>
            <li>Manual Work</li>
            <li>Muscle Development</li>
            <li>Reflexes</li>
        </ul>

        <p>When a task is completed, the Gamemaster will assign a certain amount of points to the player that goes into
            a
            particular category. When a category reaches 100 points, it is reset to 0 and the player can obtain a new
            skill
            related to that category, or
            the player can improve an old skill by 1d10%, but it has to be related to the experience category. It is
            recommended that the
            Gamemaster use this table to assign experience points:</p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Task Difficulty</th>
                    <th>Points Given</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Very Easy</td>
                    <td>1</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Easy</td>
                    <td>2</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average</td>
                    <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Hard</td>
                    <td>4</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Very Hard</td>
                    <td>5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Heroic</td>
                    <td>6</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Also, instead of improving a skill or getting a new one, you can add
            to your LFP. Roll 1d10.</p>

        <p>EXAMPLE: Drygar Farseer attempts to leap across a narrow canyon, grab a vine in the center, and swing across
            to
            the other side. The Gamemaster determines that this is a Very Hard task (Drygar has a Manual Dexterity score
            of
            46% and an Agility score of 21%, as well as a Jump skill of 37%). Drygar successfully rolls against both
            scores
            and his skill, so he
            completes the task. He gains 5 experience points and divides them up between his Manual Work and Reflexes
            categories. This brings his Reflexes score to
            100, so he resets the category and improves his Jump skill by 7%(he rolled a 7 on the 1d10%). He now has a
            Jump
            skill of 44%.</p>

        <h3>Weapons Experience</h3>

        <p>When a character uses a weapon, he will gain experience as well. Unlike character experience, weapon
            experience
            is given in levels.When a weapon is used, the wielder will gain 1 weapon experience point. This point goes
            into
            that weapon's experience
            cache. When the cache reaches 50, then the weapon goes up a level and the cache is reset. As weapon level
            increases, the character can perform more difficult maneuvers with less difficulty. Use this table for such
            maneuvers:</p>

        <table>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Maneuver Difficulty
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Base Chance of Success
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>Damage Modifier
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Very Easy(stab)
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p> 70%
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>-1
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Easy(parry)
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>55%
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>0
                </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Average(overhead smash)
                </td>

            </tr>
            <tr>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>
                    <p>Very Hard(Death blow)
                </td>
                <td>
                    <p>10%
                </td>

                <td>
                    <p>x4
                </td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <p>For each new weapon level, the character gains 1d20% in that
            weapon's chance of success. All weapons start at Level 1.</p>
        <p>EXAMPLE: Drygar Farseer tries to smash an orc over the head
            with his mace. Normally, this would be a 40% chance,
            but since Drygar is Level 3 with the mace, he has a
            75% chance (he rolled 18 at Level 2 and 17 at level 3).
            He rolls versus the chance and gets a 23 - a complete
            success. Now the orc has a chance to deflect the blow;
            see Combat.</p>

        <h3>Races</h3>

        <p>Races play an important part of the game. Each one has advantages and disadvantages. </p>

        <h4>Human</h4>

        <p>Bonuses: None</p>
        <p>Penalties: None</p>

        <p>Humans are the most common race in Iridium Fantasy. They tend to be aggressive, but not overly so. Humans are
            usually about 5'6" tall and weigh 160 lbs.</p>

        <p>Subspecies:</p>

        <p>None</p>

        <h4>Elf</h4>

        <p>Bonuses: +5% to Intelligence, +5% to Manual Dexterity, +5% to Perception</p>
        <p>Penalties: -15% to Physical Strength</p>
        <p>Elves are also known as the Fey. They are short(about 4'5" avg.)
            and have pointed ears. They have excellent sight and are among
            the best archers in the world. They are also light(about 80 lbs).</p>
        <p>Subspecies:</p>

        <h5>Noble Elf</h5>

        <p>Noble elves are those of royal blood. They rule over all the
            other elves. Unlike other elves, they are arrogant and will
            occasionally(40% chance) irritate someone beyond the limit,
            at which time that someone will probably take violent action
            against the elf. Noble elves are taller than others(5' avg.).
            They will tend to wear expensive clothing and gain a +1d20
            bonus to starting money. Noble elves cannot be warriors.</p>

        <h5>Wood Elf</h5>

        <p>Wood elves are the woodland species of elf. They are very
            quiet when in the woods(RACIAL SKILL: Move Silently: Woods 45%).
            They are never arrogant, although they are extremely wary
            of nonelven races. Wood elves tend to be dressed in handmade
            forestcolored clothing(like deerhide jackets, etc.). They
            are best suited as scouts or wardens(+1 to experience earned
            if the wood elf is a scout or warden).</p>

        <h5>Sand Elf</h5>

        <p>Sand elves, or desert elves as they are called by humans,
            are the most enigmatic of the elves. They do not obey laws
            set out by noble elves. Sand elves have a nomadic social
            structure based on family groups, or clans. They are very
            hard to spot in the desert(RACIAL SKILL: Invisibility: Desert 65%).
            Rarely will a sand elf leave the desert. They have a dark
            complexion and dress in sand-colored clothing. </p>

        <h5>Dark Elf</h5>

        <p>Dark elves are the most dangerous of elves. Like the
            sand elves, they don't obey noble elf laws. Unlike the
            other elves, dark elves live underground. They hate
            sunlight(-10% to all rolls when in sunlight). Dark elves
            have black skin, white hair, and red or dark purple eyes.
            They wear clothing made of black hide that is believed
            to come from an unknown type of predator that lives deep
            underground. Dark elves will ALWAYS be of an evil alignment,
            and are hated by all other elves. They can, however, see
            in the dark(RACIAL SKILL: Nightvision 50%). </p>

        <h4>Dwarf</h4>

        <p>Bonuses: +10% to Manual Dexterity, RACIAL SKILL: Craft Weapon: Axe 45%, +1d4 LFP</p>
        <p>Penalties: -100% to Magical Aptitude! Dwarves CANNOT use magic!</p>

        <p>Dwarves are short, stocky fellows. They love metal, and they are
            recognized as the world's greatest smiths. They tend to be about
            5' tall and weigh around 180 lbs. </p>
        <p>Subspecies:</p>

        <h5>Mountain Dwarf</h5>

        <p>Mountain dwarves are the most common type of dwarf. They live
            underground in mountains. They are the greatest smiths of all
            the dwarven race(RACIAL SKILL: Craft Weapon or Craft Armor 55%)
            Mountain dwarves are friendly to all other dwarves except the
            shadow dwarves. They usually dress in leather and rough cloth.</p>

        <h5>Plains Dwarf</h5>

        <p>Plains dwarves are the only type of dwarf that live above ground.
            They love the sunlight and build large cities. Like mountain dwarves,
            they HATE shadow dwarves(40% chance of attacking a shadow dwarf on sight).
            Plains dwarves are taller than other dwarves(about 5'3"), but weigh
            about the same. They appreciate worldly goods, and usually dress in
            light, fine cloth. </p>

        <h5>Shadow Dwarf</h5>

        <p>Shadow dwarves are the dwarven equivalent of dark elves. They hold
            a fierce hatred of all other dwarves, and will(100% chance) attack
            any kin they see(this includes other shadow dwarves). They have no
            social structure, but seem to be able to control some part of their
            evil nature. Unlike dark elves, they are not completely ruled by evil.
            Shadow dwarves dress in black and dark grey clothing. Their hair is
            usually a pale grey to white, and their eyes are black. They have pale
            gray skin.</p>

        <h3>Occupations</h3>

        <h4>Warriors</h4>

        <h5>Knight</h5>

        <p>Requirements: Physical Strength 70%</p>
        <p> Manual Dexterity 40%</p>
        <p> Bravery 45%</p>
        <p> Endurance 75%</p>
        <p>Allowed races: Human</p>
        <p>Starting Money: 1d10x100 gold</p>
        <p>Starting Equipment: Chain mail, long sword, horse, lance</p>
        <p>Occupational Skills: Swordplay 45+1d10%, Jousting 35+1d20%</p>
        <p>Knights make up a large portion of human armies. Player knights
            who are adventuring are usually either Questing Knights or Rogue Knights.
            Life Force Point Modifier: Multiply LFP times 1.5(round up)</p>

        <p>Suboccupations:</p>

        <h6>Questing Knight</h6>

        <p>Questing Knights are those knights who take up a quest. This
            quest is given to the knight by a god(dess). Hence, the Gamemaster
            will assign the quest. It must be something that requires the
            maximum effort by the player, but nothing so difficult that a starting
            character cannot achieve it.</p>

        <h6>Rogue Knight</h6>

        <p> Rogue Knights are outlaws, knights who have shunned honor and chivalry
            in favor of fame and riches. They are hunted by other knights, and are
            never welcome in towns where the knight is known of. </p>

        <h6>Soldier Knight</h6>

        <p>This is the typical knight. Soldier Knights can only be played by a
            player if the other players are also Soldier Knights. </p>

        <h5>Mercenary</h5>

        <p>Requirements: Physical Strength 50%</p>
        <p> Bravery 30%</p>
        <p>Allowed races: All</p>
        <p>Starting Money: 2d20 gold</p>
        <p>Starting Equipment: Leather armor, Short sword</p>
        <p>Occupational Skills: Tracking 35+1d10%, Bartering 25+1d20%, Swordplay 30+1d8%</p>
        <p>Mercenaries are warriors who roam the countryside looking for someone
            to hire them as extra help in a war or just as raiders. Most often they
            will be willing to work for anyone, as long as the pay is good.
            Gamemasters should determine how much a mercenary is paid depending on the
            job they are given.</p>
        <p>Life Force Point Modifier: Multiply LFP times 1.25(round up)</p>

        <p>Suboccupations:</p>

        <h6>Regular mercenary</h6>

        <h6>Bounty Hunter</h6>

        <p>Bounty hunters are mercenaries who look for only one person. They
            are usually hired by desperate law enforcement agencies who want

        <h2>Combat</h2>

        <p>As explained above, all weapons have a maneuver chance of success. When a roll is successful, then the user
            hits
            the target. However, the target can ALSO roll weapon maneuver to block the attack. If the target still
            fails,
            then the attacker rolls the damage of the weapon. If the target is wearing armor, then the armor will take
            the
            damage before the target(roll
            maneuver chance of success for armor as well, and if the result is less than the percent of the attack's
            chance
            of success, then the armor is breached and the target takes damage. If the result is more than said percent,
            then the armor is strong enough to
            deflect the attack) if the armor roll is successful. Each type of armor has an amount of armor points that
            are
            taken away when damage is done
            to the armor.</p>
        <p>When a character's(player or nonplayer) Life Force Points reaches 0, the character is knocked unconscious.
            When
            the character's LFP reaches -5, the character is killed. Killed characters cannot be healed. </p>

        <p><strong>Example Of Combat:</strong> Continuing Drygar's battle with the orc:</p>

        <p> The orc failed his roll to deflect Drygar's attack,
            so now he takes damage. Drygar rolls a 4 on
            1d6(the mace's damage roll). The orc is wearing
            leather armor, which has 5 Armor Points. It fails its armor roll.</p>

        <p> That leaves the orc with only 1 Armor Point remaining.</p>

        <p> Time for retaliation! The orc rolls to hit Drygar,
            getting a 53%. However, since the orc was attempting
            an Average maneuver, he misses Drygar completely.
            Drygar brings his mace around again, and successfully
            rolls to hit the orc with a Hard maneuver. The orc
            tries to block the attack. He needs a 24%.
            Rolls....the orc gets a 21%, successfully blocking
            the attack. Now the orc strikes again, this time
            successfully. He also manages to get past Drygar's
            blocking attempt, and his armor roll, and rolls 1d8 (scimitar damage),
            getting an 8! Drygar has chain mail, which has
            20 Armor Points. The chain mail is reduced to 12
            Armor Points. Drygar's counterattack hits and gets
            past the orc's block, and his armor roll, and Drygar rolls damage again.
            This time he gets a 5, and destroys the orc's armor.
            Also, he knocks the orc unconscious, since he only
            had 4 LFP. Unwilling to be attacked again, Drygar
            rolls to hit, the orc fails its armor roll, and Drygar rolls damage (no blocking roll), getting a 6 and
            killing
            the orc.</p>

        <h2>Magic</h2>

        <p>Magic in the Iridium system is handled in this way:
            The mage's player rolls To Tap first, to determine if he
            can tap the natural energies flowing around him.</p>

        <h3>To Tap</h3>

        <p>Roll against the mage's Use Magic skill. If this is successful, then the mage taps the energy.</p>

        <h3>Casting</h3>

        <p>The second step in using magic is to determine what the mage is
            trying to do. For the example, I will use a pyromancer as the mage.
            He wants to create a wall of fire in front of a cave.
            The Gamemaster then determines what Skill Level this spell is at,
            and the character uses his Arcane Knowledge modifier and rolls
            against his Use Magic score. Here are the tables mentioned:</p>

            reaches 100 it is reset and the character can modify things. </p>
        <p>Spell experience can be used to add to either his Arcane Knowledge or Use Magic skill. It cannot be used to
            gain
            new skills, unless the new skill is related to the caster's field of magic. EXAMPLE: A new skill for a
            terramancer might be Detect Rock Ins
            tability. However, Spell Experience may be used to add to Life Force Points. The caster may add 1d10 LFP

            time his spell experience is upgraded.</p>

        <h3>Monster Creation</h3>

        <p>Since the Iridium system is based on customization, I will leave all monster creation up to you. For now. If
            this
            game receives enough attention, I will write a Sourcebook for it that will have a monster list in it, as
            well as
            many other things that I
            may forget to add in this edition. For now, use this format to create monsters:</p>

        <p>Name: Monster's name</p>
        <p>LFP: Life Force Points, in dice(2d6, 1d8, etc.)</p>
        <p>Size: Monster's size in height, width, and length</p>
        <p>Weight: Monster's weight</p>
        <p>Speed: Monster's maximum speed in feet per second</p>
        <p>Attacks: Monster's types of attacks, and damage rolls</p>
        <p>Special Abilities: Special abilities such as nightvision, telepathy, etc.</p>
        <p>Movement Type: Flight, slither, etc.</p>
        <p>Appearance: A description of the monster's appearance</p>
