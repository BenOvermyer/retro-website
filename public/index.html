    <h1>Updates</h1>
    <h2>November 8th, 2019</h2>
    <p>This morning I uploaded a bunch of my old content from the 1990s. It's still really rough, HTML-wise. I made the
      style use CSS and fixed a bug in the Iridium Fantasy font usage from way back then. That's a 20 year bug! Have a
      look around. I'll be bringing the HTML into modern standards, though I'll keep the retro visuals.

    <p>Regained access to this account after years of not having my credentials anymore. Looking forward to being
      random!

    <p>I never did post that JavaScript trick. And now I rarely, if ever, write JS.</p>
    <h2>December 12th, 2014</h2>
    <p>Got an idea for a JS trick. Will post it when it's done.</p>
