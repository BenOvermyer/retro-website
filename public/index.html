  <h1>Sith Lord&#39;s Retro RPG Trove</h1>

  <p>This website is a collection of tabletop RPGs and materials for them. I've written all of these, though some are very old.</p>

  <p>The aesthetic is intentionally reminiscent of the 90s, though with a few modern touches.</p>

  <h2>Games</h2>

  <p>These are tabletop RPGs I've written. They're listed in order of age, with the newest first.</p>

<p>Rebuilt the site in Hugo, since formatting these RPGs is becoming a pain. Now they're in Markdown behind the scenes,
which makes it much easier for me to translate them into other formats (e.g., PDF).</p>
<h3 id="november-25th-2019">November 25th, 2019</h3>
<p>Added a placeholder page for Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire.</p>

<p>This morning I uploaded a bunch of my old content from the 1990s. It's still really rough, HTML-wise. I made the
style use CSS and fixed a bug in the Iridium Fantasy font usage from way back then. That's a 20 year bug! Have a
look around. I'll be bringing the HTML into modern standards, though I'll keep the retro visuals.</p>

<p>Regained access to this account after years of not having my credentials anymore. Looking forward to being
random!</p>
<p>I never did post that JavaScript trick. And now I rarely, if ever, write JS.</p>
<h3 id="december-12th-2014">December 12th, 2014</h3>
<p>Got an idea for a JS trick. Will post it when it's done.</p>

<p>Quick update to show I still live.</p>
