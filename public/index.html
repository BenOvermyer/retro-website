    <h1>Sith Lord's RPG Trove</h1>

    <p>This website is my personal tabletop role-playing game creations website. I write things and dump them here.</p>
    <p>This includes some very old creations of mine. Soon, there will be newer creations too.</p>

    <h2>Updates</h2>

    <h3>November 25th, 2019</h3>

    <p>Added a placeholder page for <a href="vd2.html">Vox Draconis 2</a>.</p>

    <h3>November 8th, 2019</h3>

    <p>This morning I uploaded a bunch of my old content from the 1990s. It's still really rough, HTML-wise. I made the
      style use CSS and fixed a bug in the Iridium Fantasy font usage from way back then. That's a 20 year bug! Have a
      look around. I'll be bringing the HTML into modern standards, though I'll keep the retro visuals.
    </p>

    <h3>November 5th, 2019</h3>

    <p>Regained access to this account after years of not having my credentials anymore. Looking forward to being
      random!
    </p>
    <p>I never did post that JavaScript trick. And now I rarely, if ever, write JS.</p>

    <h3>December 12th, 2014</h3>

    <p>Got an idea for a JS trick. Will post it when it's done.</p>

    <h3>December 8th, 2014</h3>

    <p>Quick update to show I still live.</p>
