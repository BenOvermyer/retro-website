Part 1: Introduction To Timescape
=================================

Timescape is a Vox Draconis setting in which the Rifts have been
permanently torn open, and wizards have gained knowledge of chronomagic,
or time magic. This knowledge is a threat and also an aid to the people
of Vox Draconis. This manual will illustrate 2 new planes and their
denizens, equipment lists, and other interesting accessories for Vox
Draconis Timescape campaigns. You must own a copy of the Vox Draconis
Basic Rules.

Part 3: The Third Plane: Law
============================

Section A: Description
----------------------

The Plane of Law is a plane of complete order. It is very difficult for
inhabitants of other planes to live here, because here no one has
different thoughts. No monsters live here, only humanoid creatures
called Robots that cannot think for themselves. There is no day or
night, just an eternal darkness. This plane is considered more dangerous
than any other plane, except the Plane of Evil.

There aren\'t any monsters in the Plane of Law.

No new equipment.

Plane of Law and gained an independent mind. They have a +5 to
Perception, but they are completely blind, since they don\'t even have
eyes. They use their other senses at superhuman levels. Robots have
black skin and are bald. They tend to become good-aligned when they
leave the Plane of Law, and try to right wrongs.

Section E: New Classes
----------------------
