## Updates

### January 29th, 2020

Rebuilt the site in Hugo, since formatting these RPGs is becoming a pain. Now they're in Markdown behind the scenes,
which makes it much easier for me to translate them into other formats (e.g., PDF).

### November 25th, 2019

Added a placeholder page for Vox Draconis: Kingdoms of Stone and Fire.

### November 8th, 2019

This morning I uploaded a bunch of my old content from the 1990s. It's still really rough, HTML-wise. I made the
  style use CSS and fixed a bug in the Iridium Fantasy font usage from way back then. That's a 20 year bug! Have a
  look around. I'll be bringing the HTML into modern standards, though I'll keep the retro visuals.

### November 5th, 2019

Regained access to this account after years of not having my credentials anymore. Looking forward to being
  random!

I never did post that JavaScript trick. And now I rarely, if ever, write JS.

### December 12th, 2014

Got an idea for a JS trick. Will post it when it's done.

### December 8th, 2014

Quick update to show I still live.
